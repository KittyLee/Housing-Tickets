User Stories for RH-Maintenance 

Lead developer: Katherine Ortiz



About the APP:
This app is about helping tenants in NYCHA (Red Hook Projects),
On getting the tenants maintenance issues done on time and more efficiently.
The tenants will be able to contact contractors directly, and also see what workers
are actually doing good work or bad work. In a ddition to that the workers will be able to talk
to the tenants about the issue then later see their review on their page.
This helps out the housing assistants on seeing everything, from what tenants need work done 
down to what worker is doing the job and how good they are actually doing the job. 


Story 1:  As an housing assistant I would like to see what work is being done in the tenants home and see what worker is doing the job, so I can keep track.

Story 2: As an housing assistant I want to be able to see what workers are actually working on and how long it takes them and to keep track of them.

Story 3: As a long time tenant I want to be able to communicate with my local contractor when something is messed up in my apartment.

Story 4: As a long time tenant I want to be able to get my refrigerator fixed on time and fast so I can then go and buy food again instead of eating out.

Story 5: As a new tenant to able to see what workers are around so that I know I would have someone at my apartment fast if I need any work done.

Story 6: As a tenant I want to see how well the workers are doing so that I will know who's doing a good job and who's not.

Story 7: As a contractor I would like a better way to see what tenants need done in their apartment so I can an efficient way to help them way out.
